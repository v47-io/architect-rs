Architect is a straightforward and technology-agnostic project scaffolding tool.

This means you can prepare templates for projects using any technology and Architect will spit out a perfect new
project.

For its templating Architect uses the Handlebars templating language. Please check the documentation for more
information.

## [&gt;&gt; ðŸ“š Documentation &lt;&lt;](https://v47-io.github.io/architect-rs/)

## TL;DR

Architect uses Handlebars and Git to create proper projects from template repositories.

1. Add any file to your template repository and add Handlebars expressions to it. ([docs][rendering-docs])
2. Add an `.architect.json` configuration file with your questions ([docs][config-docs])
3. Download the `architect` executable for your platform from the
   latest [Release](https://github.com/v47-io/architect-rs/releases).
4. Execute `architect <PATH-TO-REPO>` in your desired local directory, answer user-defined questions, et voila, you got
   a fully functional project created from a template. ([docs][cli-docs])
